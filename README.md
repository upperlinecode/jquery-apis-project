# JQuery, JSON, and APIs Project

Welcome! In this project you get the opportunity to deep dive into using the javascript `$.json()` method to make calls (GET requests) to the API of your choice, and then display that data using Material Design Cards.

This is a multi step project, but by the time you're done you'll have a webpage that pulls in data from an API and displays it beautifully using material design!

## Instructions

Feel free to fork and clone this lab for starter boilerplate code, or start your own project from scratch (good practice!). In the boilerplate, we've already linked to Materialize and jQuery.

### Pick a API to work with.

[This list](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) is a fantastic compilation of excellent APIs. For simplicity's sake, try to pick an API that does not require an API Access Token or OAUTH.

### Pull data from your API endpoint

### Access the first item from your API and display it on your screen.

### Use jQuery to create and append a Materialize card to the page

### Integrate your data from the API into the Card

### Iterate through your array and create a card for each object

### Advanced: Add interactivity to your cards.
