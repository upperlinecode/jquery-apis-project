# JQuery, JSON, and APIs Project

Welcome! In this project you get the opportunity to deep dive into using the javascript `$.json()` method to make calls (GET requests) to the API of your choice, and then display that data using Material Design Cards.

This is a multi step project, but by the time you're done you'll have a webpage that pulls in data from an API and displays it beautifully using material design!

## Instructions

Feel free to fork and clone this lab for starter boilerplate code, or start your own project from scratch (good practice!). In the boilerplate, we've already linked to Materialize and jQuery.
